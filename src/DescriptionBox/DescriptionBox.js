                An ecommerce store, short for electronic commerce store, is an online platform where
                businesses and individuals sell products or services over the internet. 
                It allows customers to browse through a catalog of items, select products 
                they want to purchase, and complete transactions electronically. 
                Ecommerce stores leverage the power of the internet to facilitate the buying and selling
                of goods and services without the need for physical presence.
